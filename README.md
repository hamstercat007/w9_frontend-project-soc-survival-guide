# SOC Survival Guide Front End

This is the Front End repository for a Full Stack Application to help School of Code Bootcampers 
throughout their learning journey by providing learning resources, inspirational
quotes, a Mindset page to motivate students, and a Self Care page with a timer you can set to remind you to take breaks,
and when trying to keep active through suggested exercise activities.
